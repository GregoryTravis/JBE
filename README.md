JBE: Emacs For Def Beats
======
I wrote this in like 2000; it's old enough that I put "J" in the name because I wrote it in Java.

You use the mouse, of course, but almost every action (other than moving time around) is done with the keyboard.  There are no menus, but there is tab completion, and even mode line.
