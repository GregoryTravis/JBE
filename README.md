JBE: Emacs For Def Beats
======

JBE is a mostly-keyboard loop editor. It's good for trawling through audio
looking for loops, and for stretching and arranging them. It uses fast,
high-quality sinc-based interpolation for resampling.

I wrote this in like 2000; it's old enough that I put "J" in the name because I wrote it in Java.

You use the mouse, of course, but almost every action (other than moving time around) is done with the keyboard.  There are no menus, but there is tab completion, and even a mode line.
